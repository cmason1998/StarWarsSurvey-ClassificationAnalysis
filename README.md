<h1 align="center"> Austin 311 Classification Analysis </h1> <br>

<p align="center">
  Data analytics project using the Austin 311 public dataset. Note, this repository is only to used to store current versions of the project's jupyter notebooks since the dataset file is very large. Thus, devs should download a copy of the dataset to store locally on their computer when editing notebooks, described below.
</p>

## To Use the Dataset
* Go to [this link.](https://data.austintexas.gov/Utilities-and-City-Services/Austin-311-Public-Data/xwdj-i9he) 
* Click Export and Download as CSV. Make sure the resulting file is named "Austin_311_Public_Data" for use in our project notebooks.
* Put it in the same directory as the jupyter notebooks you are working on and you are good to go.

### Note
* Please do NOT upload the dataset to the repository, as GitHub will then not allow me any more storage to upload more files.
* If keeping a local copy of the dataset doesn't work for us, we can later change to using [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to upload our dataset.
